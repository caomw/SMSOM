{"name":"SMSOM for Background Modeling","tagline":"Stacked Multi-layer Self-Organizing Map for Background Modeling","body":"#Stacked Multi-layer Self-Organizing Map for Background Modeling (SMSOM-BM)\r\n\r\nAn implementation of our unpublished paper **[1]**, and the experiment results of **[1]** are based on it. If you have any question, please feel free to contact zhaozj89@gmail.com.\r\n\r\n#Preferred working environment\r\n\r\n* Windows 7 (64bit)\r\n\r\n\r\n* Visual Studio 2010\r\n\r\n\r\n* OpenCV 2.4.5\r\n\r\n\r\n* CUDA 5.0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#How to use\r\n\r\n\r\n###For Windows users:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe executable is **.\\Debug\\smsom.exe**; therefore, you should first use **cmd** in Windows to navigate to the directory **Debug**. Please ENSURE Windows can find OpenCV library, and you have CUDA compatible GPU installed in your computer.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen you have two options:\r\n\r\n* If you have foreground free traning images, then execute:\r\n\r\n  `smsom train <start_frame_number> <end_frame_number> <input_file_name> <output_file_name>`\r\n    \r\n  where `<start_frame_number>` and `<end_frame_number>` stand for the index range of the training images; `<input_file_name>`     is the format of the input image's name, and the last parameter `<output_file_name>` is optional, if you omit it, then the      output images are just shown in you screen, but not stored in your computer. \r\n\r\n  For example, if I put the input images in: **E:\\Data\\input\\**, \r\n  the image files' name format is: **in000001.jpg** (any number), and I use 1-100 images to train the model, then I can execute:\r\n\r\n  `smsom train 1 100 E:\\\\Data\\\\input\\\\in%06d.jpg E:\\\\Data\\\\results\\\\bin%06d.jpg`\r\n\r\n  where I put the result images in **E:\\Data\\results**.\r\n\r\n  or\r\n\r\n  `smsom train 1 100 E:\\\\Data\\\\input\\\\in%06d.jpg`\r\n\r\n  where I do not store the output images.\r\n  \r\n* If you do not have foreground free training images, you can execute:\r\n  \r\n  `smsom nottrain <input_file_name> <output_file_name>`\r\n\r\n  where the meanings of `<input_file_name>` and `<output_file_name>` (optional) are the same as the previous case. In this situation, we set the threshold tau=0.06 (see **[1]** for more details). \r\n \r\n###For Linux users:\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have to build yourself. The source code of 3 layer SMSOM-BM is **.\\smsom\\main.cu**, and you can refer to **[2]** for how to use CUDA on Linux platform.\r\n\r\n\r\nDemos\r\n=====\r\nSome demo scripts are shown as follows (assuming you are in **Debug** directory, and you have decompressed dataset **[3]** in **E:\\Data\\**):\r\n\r\n* fountain01: ``smsom train 1 399 E:\\\\Data\\\\dynamicBackground\\\\fountain01\\\\input\\\\in%06d.jpg``\r\n* highway: ``smsom nottrain E:\\\\Data\\\\baseline\\\\highway\\\\input\\\\in%06d.jpg``\r\n* traffic: ``smsom train 129 200 E:\\\\Data\\\\cameraJitter\\\\traffic\\\\input\\\\in%06d.jpg``\r\n* ladeSide: ``smsom train 1 999 E:\\\\Data\\\\thermal\\\\lakeSide\\\\input\\\\in%06d.jpg``\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n=====\r\n\r\n[1] Zhenjie Zhao, Xuebo Zhang, and Yongchun Fang.
